kmeans doubts

1) can we find out the values of tot.ss, tot.withinss,betweenss values with python code.
2) cant we use scale function in python also to normalize the values instead of defining new function.
3) what is the significance of kselection in r, most of the time it is giving me value of k as 2, which i dont find useful.
